In this assignment we will be implementing a full stack project in Javascript based on React frontend, and Express on top of Node in the backend using MongoDB and Mongoose for the model. You will be selecting a React UI framework to implement your website.

### Full Stack Implementation

#### Project Front End
You will be using React-Redux in the front end. The front end must be separated correctly following the MVC pattern. Your Model must consist of the redux-store, along side its actions and their enums, reducers and redux-store. Your View must be implemented in stateless React components in combination of one of the react-ui frameworks suggested above. Finally, the communication with the server must be handled via redux-sagas.

#### Project Back End
You will be implementing your backend on top of Express which will run on top of Node. The model will be stored in MongoDB. Using Mongoose library you may define schemas that will assist you to access the database in order to apply commands and queries on.

#### Project Libraries
There are several base libraries to be used and several mandatory additional libraries that need to be incorporated on your project. In additional to that it is very encouraged to find suitable libraries that assist you in implementing the required features with much ease. npmjs contains hundreds of thousands of libraries to choose from. Using npm trends maybe provide you some information regarding the popularity of a certain library.


### Fast-Food Review Platform
Fast-food chains review platform. Plenty of people go to these, but they are not a popular review candidate! You will be designing and creating a fast-food chains oriented review platform. The features will be especially designed for this type of content. What matters to fast-food customers is different from what matters to regular restaurant customers!

In fast-food chains every menu is pretty much the same, and the food always tastes the same as well. However, if you visited many of these chain restaurants, you know there are a few things that differ wildly, and as a result, the dining experience is different.

Which one has the most luxurious bathroom? Which ones mark up their menu prices? Which ones are overly crowded? And many other questions that might pop up in your head!
